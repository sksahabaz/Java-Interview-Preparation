# Linked List Cycle II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given the `head` of a linked list, return  *the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return* `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle.  **Note that**  `pos`  **is not passed as a parameter**.

 **Do not modify**  the linked list.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

 

 **Follow up:**  Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

            temp = temp.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
